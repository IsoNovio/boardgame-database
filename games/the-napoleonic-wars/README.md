# [The Napoleonic Wars](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36399/the-napoleonic-wars-second-edition)

- by GMT Games

## What's Here

- I translated it into Chinese

- based on the 2nd edition (2008)

- includes [prompted changes by Gareth Williams](https://sites.google.com/site/wilphe/tnw/2019/3rd-edition-test-at-wbc) for a 3rd edition tested at the WBC in 2019
  
  - despite neither finalized nor official, I included it because me and my friends only play this version which, in our opinions, makes the game design more consistent
