## What's Here

### Game Version

- based on the 2nd edition (2008)

- includes [prompted changes by Gareth Williams](https://sites.google.com/site/wilphe/tnw/2019/3rd-edition-test-at-wbc) for a 3rd edition tested at the WBC in 2019
  
  - despite neither finalized nor official, I included it because me and my friends only play this version which, in our opinion, makes the game design more consistent

### Translation

- I translated the game into Chinese:
  
  - rules
  
  - cards and reserves
  
  - the map
  
  - markers 

### Art

- I created Here I Stand/Virgin Queen/Tanto Monta style counters for army leaders

- I created my own art for the cards and reserves

- I created nation mats which include each nation's
  
  - basic info
  
  - reserve(s)
  
  - force pool
  
  - leader commands

- I updated the map to mark duchies that are
  
  - Trade Centers for #91 Egyptian Venture
  
  - Trade Centers for #93 Baltic Venture
  
  - crucial for the 3rd edition's new card #106 Emperor of Austria
